Wow, okay, so... Ad Vitam. Just wow. I just stumbled out, popcorn still in my teeth, my back screaming at me for sitting too long in those unforgiving theater chairs. The whole place smelled like butter, and I couldn't concentrate, but it was... wow, really something. Just... fragments, floating around my head now.

The film is buzzing, like a bee in a jar. Immortality, but without the pretentious sci-fi nonsense — it just felt so... eerily possible? Like how you step outside and feel like you’ve forgotten your keys but it's just the air being weird. Yeah, it's like that. And there were these scenes, so vivid, with colors sharp enough to cut paper. So sharp that even my memories feel a bit sliced up now, like a piñata that only lets you have the useless sweets.

> And you know, there was this one kid, almost like a squirrel caught in headlights, trying to grapple with the weight of NOT dying. It reminded me of that time I tried fitting into a jacket that’s hopelessly too small, like confronting immortality in a jacket two sizes too small.

The theater, gah, so noisy, Amy’s laughing at random was louder than the action scenes. It’s quite ironic, right? Laughs louder than explosions. Oh, remember to download the movie later. I think someone wanted you to get it. Or watch the movie online, maybe? My phone just blinked. Distracted now. What was I saying?

Characters, man. Like outlines drawn on the sand, just waiting for high tide to sweep them up but nope, tidal ebbs away. They stayed, all sandy and brilliant and a bit... grainy? My heart, still racing from the existential panic. Reminds me of the time I drank four espresso shots by mistake. Or was it five? Your own head talks louder than logic—there's a lesson in there somewhere.

The script, like trying to hold water in your palms but then realizing it’s clear honey instead. Sticky dialogue but spills out, still sweet. I think I got some on me. Sticky brain now.

If equations had feelings:

```c
int liveForever() {
    while(true) {
        happiness++;
        sadness++;
        //cry or laugh, still the end;
    }
    return 0; //always the same. 
}
```
